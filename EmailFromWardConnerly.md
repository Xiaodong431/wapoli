“Let me also say that this whole I-1000 process has been extraordinarily heart-warming for me, 
because of one fact.  In 1995, when I first challenged affirmative action at the University of California, 
my closest friend was David Lee, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur of Chinese descent.  
I frequently asked David why Asian applicants never spoke up about discrimination against them, 
even in the face of evidence that we had which showed radically higher standards for Asian Americans 
than for any other demographic groups.  He said the reason was mostly cultural, namely that in Asian culture, 
silence is the preferred approach. Also, Asian Americans didn’t want to seen as “greedy” about the number 
of admission slots allocated to them.  Finally, he said that many Asian students were often pressured to 
support “students of color” and they didn’t want to provoke dissension between Asian Americans and 
“students of color.”  I am personally thrilled that your group has the courage to defend the critical 
principle of equality.  Btw, before we eliminated preferential treatment in CA, the % of Asians at 
UC was about 22%. After we eliminated race preferences, the number escalated to about 42%, which 
confirmed the perverse extent to which race was being used against Asians. I have no doubt that 
there will be a similar result, in reverse, with Asians in WA.  So, I am very excited about your 
engagement in the democratic process, Linda!”
